# Home_Assistant-Config

Currently home automation config consist of Alexa Echo (1),Dots(2), Xiaoma switches(14) and sensors(10), Harmony Hub(1) and Tradfri bulbs (6). I have resently updated all automations to use Appdeamon 3.0 as I was struggling to understand the automation syntax and Jinja2 code.

Update: I know understand the automation and Jinja2 code so I have stopped using Appdeamon (almost) ;)

Home Assistant was updated from Domoticz and before that LightwaveRf so I have a legacy Dimmer commands (Bright, Relaxed and Dark) for the living room. Living room had 6 lights on a single Lightwaverf Dimmer  switch , with the introduction  of Tradfri bulbs  I have now split the living room into living room and dining room , replaced the Lightwaverf Dimmer  switch with a Xiaomi switch and dimming is now done directly on the Tradfri bulbs via home assistant light groups. 

Update : Managed to combine everything onto one Xiaomi v3 hub so Tradri and Xiaomi all linked and Tradfri hub is ebayed
