# Home_Assistant-Config

Current config consist of Alexa Echo (1),Dots(3), Xiaoma switches(10) and sensors(6), Harmony Hub(1) and Tradfri bulbs (6). I have resently updated all automations to use Appdeamon 3.0 as I was struggling to understand the automation syntax and Jinja2 code.

Home Assistant was updated from Domoticz and before that LightwaveRf so I have a legacy Dimmer commands (Bright, Relaxed and Dark) for the living room. Living room had 6 lights on a single Lightwaverf dimmer switch , with the intoduction of Tradfri bulbs  I have now split the living room into living room and dining room , replaced the Lightwaverf Dimmer  switch with a Xiaoma wireless switch and dimming now done directly on the Tradfri bulbs.
